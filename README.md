Reanalysis of the `cortical.organoids` dataset from "Complex Oscillatory Waves Emerging from Cortical Organoids Model Early Human Brain Network Development".

Count data was generated with [alevin](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon) (v0.12.0) using GENCODE release 32 as the reference transcriptome. The raw counts can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/apcamargo/cortical-organoids-reanalysis/blob/gh-pages/cortical.organoids/exprMatrix.tsv.gz?raw=true).
